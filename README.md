# BioTalent-Website

Purpose of the website:
This website was created to promote the uOttawa BioTalent program and to generate future interest to extend the lifetime of the program beyond the Summer 2020 work term. The website primarily focuses on showcasing the projects that students worked on during the first summer of operation.

How the website was created:
The website was developed using ReactJS, a widely used front end and back end development framework, allowing websites to have a more cohesive look and increasing the readability of the code.
We learned ReactJS using a free online tutorial that can be found at the following link: 
https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact

The React repo (for more useful information) : https://github.com/facebook/react

For how to install and use React, click on the website folder and read the documentation.

The colour scheme used throughout the website:
dark blue: #1d1e3e
dark red: #641c30
light blue: #405a67
grey: #979797
black: #000000
off-white: #fffdfb

Some ideas for future work and improvements:
- Add future project overviews/team member information as required
- Add functionality to "Join Us" button on Opportunities page (link to a page with application information for students interested in being a part of the program)
- Add "FR/EN" button to navigation bar and make the website bilingual
- Improve overall aesthetics of website to increase professionalism
- Make website more functional for smaller browser windows (ex: team member information boxes, student testimonies)
- Make website mobile compatible
- Center footer information
