Our goal is to inform Policy Horizons Canada through foresight products like weak signals and insights about the potential policy implications of Biodigital innovations over the next 10 to 15 years in sectors like health, agriculture, manufacturing and security. Foresight is a methodology that can help to detect future challenges and opportunities and support policymakers in the development of robust policies."
