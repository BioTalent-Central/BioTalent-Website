	      <ProjDescription 
	      	description="The Faculty of Engineering is interested in developing an on-campus brewery & distillery facility that would be an experimental learning resource so students can apply knowledge learnt in class, increase their job-readiness and meet the recruiting needs of this rapidly growing sector of the bio-economy. During the duration of this project, we built on the existing design of a microbrewery and craft distillery previously done by two chemical engineering teams in the context of their plant design class. Particularly, we focused on the optimization of the fermentation & mashing processes, quality assurance & process control, and minimizing the facility's environmental impact by implementing waste treatment methods such as carbon capture and biomass (spent grain and yeast) reuse."
	      	motivation="The University of Ottawa provides many resources and facilities such as the MakerSpace to offer engineering students hands-on learning experiences. However, such resources are lacking for the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, so the aim of this project is to provide an experimental learning facility for these students."
