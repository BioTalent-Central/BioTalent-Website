Not only did I learn how to apply my academic knowledge to the workplace, but I also gained valuable knowledge from different areas of study since I was part of an interdisciplinary student team. For instance, I learned quite a lot about biotechnology, mechanical engineering, business, and entrepreneurship. I further obtained critical skills in project development and management, and I significantly improved my teamwork and leadership skills. Overall, it has been a truly rewarding experience; I am grateful that I was given this opportunity, especially during a worldwide pandemic. My sincere thanks go to Dr. Mads Kaern, the University of Ottawaâ€™s CO-OP Office, and BioTalent Canada, who worked together to provide us with this wonderful learning experience!"
